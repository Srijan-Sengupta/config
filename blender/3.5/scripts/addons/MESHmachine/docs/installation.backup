## Requirements

* Windows, MacOS, Linux
* Blender 2.93 (LTS), Blender 3.1 (stable)


!!! danger "Experimental Builds"
    [Experimental](https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/) Blender builds such as 3.2-alpha are **not supported**, and fixing any issues related to them, will not be a priority, but [reporting them](faq.md#get-support) is still encouraged.  


### Blender on MacOS

MacOS users should install Blender properly, by following the [official instructions](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/getting_started/installing/macos.html).  
Avoid running it just from the Downloads folder!  
Note that, for **dragging** of files and folders, you need to hold down the `COMMAND` key.  
This will ensure [AppTranslocation](img/installation/apptranslocation.jpg)[^1] is avoided. 

[^1]: Learn more about [AppTranslocation](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/app-translocation.html).


### Blender on Arch Linux

Arch Linux users and users of other Arch based or similar rolling release distros are advised to use the [official Blender builds](https://blender.org/download).  
The Blender package in the [Community repository](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/blender/) does not supply its own Python, and does not follow [official recommendations](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_tips_and_tricks.html#bundled-python-extensions).  
As a consequence, the system's python version may not work with MESHmachine.


### Latest MESHmachine

The latest version of MESHmachine is 0.11.1 - available on [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/MESHmachine) and [Blender Market](https://www.blendermarket.com/products/MESHmachine).  
See [this page](whatsnew.md) the learn what's new in the latest versions, or see the [changelog](changelog.md) for the full release history.


## Updating

### Plug Backup

!!! danger "Attention"
    If you are updating from a previous version, you are at **risk of loosing** any [Plugs](plug_creation.md) you may have created.  

If you have not chosen a plug assets location outside the MESHmachine folder in [Blender's addons folder](#blenders-addons-folder), you should backup your plugs as described in the video, and outlined below.


### Uninstallation

As a result of this [Blender/Python issue](https://developer.blender.org/T77837), you need to uninstall your old version of MESHmachine first, before installing a new one.  
You can find two approaches to do this in the Installation video, and outlined below.

!!! warning "Keep in mind"
    This is especially important for feature updates, such as from version 0.10 to 0.11.  
    <!--For bug fix updates, such as from version 0.9.0 to 0.9.1, *uninstallation can be skipped*, but installation in Blender from the zip **on top of the already installed version still needs to be avoided**.  -->
    <!--Instead you should close Blender, extract the MESHmachine_0.9.1.zip file, and copy the extracted MESHmachine folder to Blender's [addon directory](#blenders-addons-folder), replacing the existing files. -->

The same instructions as in the video, but in text form:


### 1. Fresh Installation
> NO previous version of MESHmachine installed

* start Blender, bring up preferences
* switch to the *Add-ons* tab and click the **Install...** button at the top right 
* locate the downloaded MESHmachine_0.11.1.zip file and double-click it
* activate the addon by ticking the checkbox
* ensure your preferences are saved (by default done automatically)
* close preferences and in the 3D View press the `Y` key to bring up the MESHmachine menu


### 2. Update Installation
> previous version of MESHmachine installed already

#### 2a. Update Installation in the File Browser

!!! danger "Attention"
    **Never** install MESHmachine in Blender's program folder.  
    On Windows, that would be `C:\Program Files\...`
    MESHmachine needs write access to its installation folder, so you need to install it into [Blender's addons folder](#blenders-addons-folder).

* with Blender closed, navigate to [Blender's addons folder](#blenders-addons-folder)
* find MESHmachine, and copy the MESHmachine/assets/Plugs folder to a save location to backup any custom Plugs you may have created
* remove the MESHmachine folder
* in your Downloads location, extract the MESHmachine_0.11.1.zip file
* copy the MESHmachine folder from the zip file to [Blender's addons folder](#blenders-addons-folder)
    - note, if you have a MESHmachine_0.11.1 folder after extraction, don't copy this one, instead copy the MESHmachine folder contained in it
* start Blender and check if the menu (`Y` key) comes up


#### 2b. Update Installation in Blender

* start Blender, bring up preferences
* switch to the *Add-ons* tab and use the search input at the top right to find your currently installed MESHmachine version
* unfold MESHmachine, go to the Plugs tab, and shift click on the folder icon of the assets path
* in your filebrowser copy any custom plugs you may have to a safe location
* back in Blender, deactivate your currently installed MESHmachine version
    - DO NOT click on the Remove button just yet
* ensure your preferences are saved (by default done automatically)
* quit and restart Blender
* back in the MESHmachine addon preferences, with MM now deactivated, click the Remove button
* with MM uninstalled, click the **Install...** button at the top right 
* locate the downloaded MESHmachine_0.11.1.zip file and double-click it
* activate the addon by ticking the checkbox
* ensure your preferences are saved (by default done automatically)
* close preferences and in the 3D View press the `Y` key to bring up the MESHmachine menu


### Blender's addons folder

!!! note "Addons Folder (in user scripts)"
    **Linux**: `/home/name/.config/blender/3.1/scripts/addons`  
    **MacOS**: `/Users/name/Library/Application Support/Blender/3.1/scripts/addons`  
    **Windows**: `C:\Users\name\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\3.1\scripts\addons`  

    Depending on your Blender version, replace `3.1` accordingly.
